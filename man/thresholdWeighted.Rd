\arguments{
\item{pres}{Numeric vector. Predicted values at test presences.}

\item{contrast}{Numeric vector. Predicted values at background/absence sites.}

\item{presWeight}{Numeric vector same length as \code{pres}. Relative weights of presence sites. The default is to assign each presence a weight of 1.}

\item{contrastWeight}{Numeric vector same length as \code{contrast}. Relative weights of background sites. The default is to assign each presence a weight of 1.}

\item{at}{Character or character vector, name(s) of threshold(s) to calculate. The default is to calculate them all.
\itemize{
        \item \code{'msss'}: Threshold that the maximizes the sum of sensitivity and specificity.
        \item \code{'mdss'}: Threshold that minimizes the difference between sensitivity and specificity.
        \item \code{'minPres'}: Minimum prediction across presences. This threshold is not weighted.
        \item \code{'orss'}: Threshold that maximizes the odds ratio skill score (Wunderlich et al. 2019).
        \item \code{'sedi'}: Threshold that maximizes the symmetrical extremal dependence index (Wunderlich et al. 2019).
        \item \code{'prevalence'}: Prevalence of presences (sum(presence weights) / sum(presence weights + background weights))'
        \item \code{'sensitivity'}: Threshold that most closely returns the sensitivity specified by \code{sensitivity}.
}}

\item{sensitivity}{Value of specificity to match (used only if \code{at} contains \code{'sensitivity'}).}

\item{thresholds}{Numeric vector. Thresholds at which to calculate the sum of sensitivity and specificity. The default evaluates all values from 0 to 1 in steps of 0.01.}

\item{delta}{Positive numeric >0 in the range [0, 1] and usually very small. This value is used only if calculating the SEDI threshold when any true positive rate or false negative rate is 0 or the false negative rate is 1. Since SEDI uses log(x) and log(1 - x), values of 0 and 1 will produce \code{NA}s. To obviate this, a small amount can be added to rates that equal 0 and subtracted from rates that equal 1.}

\item{na.rm}{Logical. If \code{TRUE} then remove any presences and associated weights and background predictions and associated weights with \code{NA}s.}

\item{bg}{Same as \code{contrast}. Included for backwards compatibility. Ignored if \code{contrast} is not \code{NULL}.}

\item{bgWeight}{Same as \code{contrastWeight}. Included for backwards compatibility. Ignored if \code{contrastWeight} is not \code{NULL}.}

\item{...}{Other arguments (unused).}
}
\value{
Named numeric vector.

\description{
This function is similar to the \code{\link[dismo]{threshold}} function in the \pkg{dismo} package, which calculates thresholds to create binary predictions from continuous values. However, unlike that function, it allows the user to specify weights for presences and absence/background predictions. The output will thus be the threshold that best matches the specified criterion taking into account the relative weights of the input values.

# set of bad and good predictions at presences
bad <- runif(100)^2
good <- runif(100)^0.1

# upweight bad predictions
presWeight <- c(rep(1, 100), rep(0.1, 100))

# upweight good predictions
presWeight <- c(rep(0.1, 100), rep(1, 100))
