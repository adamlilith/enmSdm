\usage{
fpbOneThreshold(
  threshold,
  pres,
  bg,
  presWeight = rep(1, length(pres)),
  bgWeight = rep(1, length(bg)),
  tr = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{threshold}{Numeric value or numeric vector within the range [0, 1]. Threshold value(s) at which to calculate Fpb.}

\item{pres}{Numeric vector. Predictions at presences.}

\item{bg}{Numeric vector. Predictions at background sites.}

\item{presWeight}{Numeric same length as \code{pres}. Weights for presence predictions.}

\item{bgWeight}{Numeric same length as \code{bg}. Weights for background predictions.}

\item{tr}{Same as \code{threshold} but deprecated. Included for backwards compatibility.}
}

Numeric.
