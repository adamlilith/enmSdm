Description: This package provides tools for implementing species distribution
	models (SDMs) and ecological niche models (ENMs). The heart of the package
	is a set of "training" functions which automatically tune and parameterize
	a models based on several popular algorithms (e.g., MaxEnt, GLMs, BRTs,
	GAMs, etc.). Ancillary tools include estimation of spatial sampling bias,
	model evaluation, and calculation of biotic velocity (speed and direction
	at which a species' range moves through time).
